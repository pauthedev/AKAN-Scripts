  - Finally...
  - I was hoping you'd make it this far.
  - Congratulations.
  - It has not been an easy mission, and I admit that it was a bit selfish to send
    a human to fight in my honor.
  - 'I have to thank you for your work. '
  - 'Despite the ignorance, you faced the depravity of the goddess Mane, and you
    emerged victorious from her mischief and insults. '
  - Return to Misore, announce your victory to the residents.
  - Celebrate the festivities and live together in peace and harmony. Return to the
    normality to which you were accustomed.
  - Blessed be you, and may the sunlight illuminate your life in the same way that
    it will illuminate your village.
  - ...
  - We'll meet again, Kinich.
